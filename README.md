# kasm

This is Kris's Assembler for the [K64](https://github.com/transitorykris/krisos).

## Goals

 * Implement the WDC 6502 instruction set
 * Provide basic assembler directives

## Non-goals

 * Implement macros

## Warning

I do not know Rust, and I don't know how to build an assembler. This is probably not the code you're looking for.
