This is Kris's Assembler for the [K64](https://github.com/transitorykris/krisos).

## Goals

 * Implement the WDC 6502 [instruction set](instructions.md) -- using the [WDC6502 datasheet](https://eater.net/datasheets/w65c02s.pdf)
 * Provide basic [assembler directives](directives.md)

I'll know when this is done because I'll be able to assemble [Microchess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchess) and it'll be byte for byte identical to ca65 or vasm.

## Non-goals

 * Implement macros

## Warning

I do not know Rust, and I don't know how to build an assembler. This is probably not the code you're looking for.
